Title: Multi-paradigm pipeline implementation for R
Version: 0.5.3.1
Author: Kun Ren <ken@renkun.me>
Maintainer: Kun Ren <ken@renkun.me>
Description: Provides various styles of function chaining methods: Pipe
    operator, Pipe object, and pipeline function, each representing a distinct
    pipeline model yet sharing almost a common set of features: A value can be
    piped to the first unnamed argument of a function, to dot symbol in an
    enclosed expression, by formula as lambda expression, for side-effect, and
    with assignment. The set of syntax is designed to make the pipeline more
    readable and friendly to a wide variety of operations.
